# mgmt-playground
This is an Ansible project with a development environment powered by Vagrant.

This project sets up:

* 3 virtual machines with Fedora/25-cloud-base

This project is intended as a demo/playground for a mgmt-introductory , teaching git, vagrant and ansible, in de most simple way, and still useable in my classroom. Surely , this playbook can still be improved, but this way it is manageable in my classroom with my students.

## Dependencies

I use as host a Fedora/25-cloud-base machine, make sure you have installed :

- vagrant
- vagrant-libvirt
- vagrant-hostmanager
- vagrant-sshfs
- ansible (ver. 2+)
- git

And enabled nested KVM

```ShellSession
$ sudo modprobe -r kvm_intel
$ sudo modprobe kvm_intel nested=1
```
view state nested KVM

```ShellSession
$ cat /sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/nested
```

## Getting started

When cloning, choose a more suiteable  name for the target directory!

```ShellSession
$ git clone https://github.com/belbob/mgmt-playground.git my-mgmt-playground
```
After cloning, it's best to remove the `.git` directory and initialise a new repository. The history of the code is most probably irrelevant for your mgmt-playground project...

Create also a new directory "gopath" inside the folder "my-mgmt-playground",and use this as workdirectory for mgmt.

### Installation mgmt-playground

Open a terminal, go to the "my-mgmt-playground" directory to store this project and issue the following commands:

create the first mgmt-vm

```ShellSession
$ vagrant up mgmt1
```
login after install:
```ShellSession
$ vagrant ssh mgmt1
```
download the mgmt code base as vagrant user inside mgmt1 vm:
```ShellSession
$ go get -u github.com/purpleidea/mgmt
```
after finishing mgmt1, logout mgmt1, now you can start the other vms

```ShellSession
$ vagrant up mgmt2
```
and
```ShellSession
$ vagrant up mgmt3
```
